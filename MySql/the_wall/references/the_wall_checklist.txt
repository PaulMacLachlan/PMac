Create a wall/forum page where users will be able to post a message and see the message displayed by other users. Stores the messages in a table called 'messages' and retrieve the messages from the database.

Create a login and registration page that is displayed when a user navigates to 'localhost:5000/'
Once the user has logged in successfully redirect them to 'localhost:5000/wall' that will show the wall.

Once you got the messages to show up (the wireframe on the left side), allow users to post comments for any message ( store the replies/comments to the message in a separate table called 'comments')

Extra Credit I (optional): allow the user to delete his/her own message.
Extra Credit II (optional): allow the user to delete his/her own message but only if the message was made in the last 30 minutes.
