ok, so youre talking to your db
ytoure inserting the correct values on signin
you are just not Validating them


next time, work on validating and encrypting the password. check to see if its in the db first, and if so, route them to the login page.

Once that works, flash an error if its the wrong password data.

once that works check to see if you can log them out.

once that works, start adding messages.

once that works, start adding comments.
