Basics
What query would you run to get all of the users?

SELECT * 
FROM users;
What query would you run to only get the first names of all of the users?
SELECT first_name 
FROM users;
What query would you run to only get the first and last names of all of the users? 
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM users;
SELECT w/ Conditionals
What query would you run to only get the first name of users with id of 2?

SELECT first_name
FROM users
WHERE id = 2;
What query would you run to get the last names of users with id of 2 or 3?

SELECT last_name
FROM users
WHERE id = 2 OR id = 3;
What query would you run to get all of the users with id greater than 2?
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE id > 2;
What query would you run to get all of the users with id less than or equal to 3?
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE id <= 3;
What query would you run to get all of the users with first names ending in "e"?
SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE first_name LIKE "%e";
What query would you run to get all of the users with first names starting in "K"?
SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE first_name LIKE "K%";
SELECT w/ Sorting
What query would you run to get all of the users with the youngest users at the top of the table?

SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY birthday DESC;
What query would you run to get all of the users with the oldest users at the top of the table?

SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY birthday ASC;
What query would you run to get all of the users with the first name that ends with "e" with the youngest users at the top of the table?

SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE first_name LIKE "%e"
ORDER BY birthday DESC;
What query would you run to get only the first names of all of the users in alphabetical order?

SELECT first_name
FROM users
ORDER BY first_name;
The default for ORDER BY is ASC so we can leave that part out if we want the sorting to be ascending.

Note
Before moving on to the next tab, it will be best to go over the following tutorials on SQL Zoo:

SELECT Basics: http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQLZOO:SELECT_basics
SELECT name: http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_names
SELECT from World: http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_WORLD_Tutorial

INSERTS:

INSERT INTO table_name (column_name1, column_name2) 
VALUES('column1_value', 'column2_value');

as in:
INSERT INTO tweets (this, that, the_other) VALUES (new_this, new_that, new_other);

UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 = 'some_value', column_name2='another_value' WHERE condition(s)

*** IMPORTANT: if WHERE condition is not added to the UPDATE statement, the changes will be applied to every record in the table.


DELETES:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition(s)
IMPORTANT: if WHERE condition is not added to the DELETE statement, it will delete all the records on the table.

CURRENT TIME STAMP: SELECT NOW() as 'Right Now';
