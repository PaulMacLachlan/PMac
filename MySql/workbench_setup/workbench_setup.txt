SELECT * FROM cities;

SELECT name
FROM cities
WHERE id = 2 OR id = 3;

SELECT * FROM countries
WHERE code;

SELECT countries.capital, countries.continent, cities.name, cities.population
FROM countries, cities;

COULD NOT GET USE [world] to work in my queries?

example:

Use [world] SELECT countries.capital, countries.continent, cities.name, cities.population
FROM countries, cities;
