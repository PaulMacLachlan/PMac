<!-- These are the routes that you need to set up:
DONE:
On the default page ('localhost:5000'), it should display a view that says "No ninjas here"
When user visits /ninja, it should display all four Ninja Turtles (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello)

TO DO:
/ninja/[ninja_color], should display the corresponding Ninja Turtle (grab the color parameter out of the requested URL)
If user visits /ninja/blue, it should only display the Ninja Turtle Leonardo.
/ninja/orange - Ninja Turtle Michelangelo.
/ninja/red - Ninja Turtle Raphael
/ninja/purple - Ninja Turtle Donatello
If a user tries to hack into your web app by specifying a color or string combination other than the colors (Blue, Orange, Red, and Purple), example: /ninja/black or /ninja/123, then display Megan Fox who was April O'Neil in the most recent ninja turtles movie.
You'll need to remember how to use static files for this assignment. Take a minute to refresh your memory back to the static files section if you need to :) -->
